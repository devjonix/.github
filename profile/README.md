# DEV Joni in GitHub

Welcome to the home of DEV Joni's open-source technologies.
Here you’ll find all public repositories for our platforms, tools, libraries, firmware, 3D models, documentation - everything we build openly.

Our mission is to develop foundational, vendor-neutral technologies that form the base layer for science, industry and research.
All repositories here are free to use, modify, and build upon.

## 🚀 Finding the right repository

You don’t need to browse randomly — the easiest way to navigate:

🔗 Project directory & documentation (Wiki)
→ [https://devjoni.com/wiki/](https://devjoni.com/wiki/)

Rather than trying to find the right repository here, directly in GitHub, it may be easier to find it via our Wiki.

## 🏭 What is DEV Joni

DEV Joni is a full-stack technology lab based in Hyrynsalmi, Finland.
We build core technologies for research and industry: hardware, firmware, software, communication protocols and development tools - all open-source.

We believe technology should be:

- 🔧 Modular
- 🤝 Interoperable
- 🌍 Open and repairable
- 🔓 Free from vendor lock-in

Anything hosted here may be used as-is, modified, or integrated into commercial or research work under our licensing terms (GPLv3-only).

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds - whether small or substantial:

- Test & report issues
- Suggest improvements

You retain rights to your contributions; the only requirement is that they remain under GPLv3-only to keep the ecosystem open.
